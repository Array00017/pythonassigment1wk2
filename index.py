#first problem solution 
#Cube Number Test... Print out all cubed numbers up to the total value 1000. Meaning that if the cubed number is over 1000 break the loop.

list_num = []

for nums in range >= 1000 
break 

print(nums)
        
        
#Second problem Solution 
#Take in a users input for their age, if they are younger than 18 print kids, if they're 18 to 65 print adults, else print seniors

age = input (what is your age)

if age < 18 
print (kids)
if age > 18 and != 65 
print (adult) 
else 
print (senior)
